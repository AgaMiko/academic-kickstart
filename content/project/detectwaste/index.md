## Detect waste with AI

We come back with a new non-profit educational project from the AI for Good series!

This time we will focus on the problem of waste in the environment with strong emphasis on plastics. For 5 months (October-February) we will learn together and work on a model for trash detection. The project is aimed at people from Tri-City, with at least intermediate Python knowledge and basic experience in Deep Learning.

The project will be attended by up to 10 participants supported by mentors (employees of StyleSage, Voicelab, BrainScan and NASA).*

Motivation

## What and why?

Today, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually. Plastic is everywhere and we constantly use it in our daily life.

The idea of Plastic object detection project is to use Artificial Intelligence to detect plastic waste in the environment. Our solution will be applicable for video and photography.

Our goal is to use AI for Good.
