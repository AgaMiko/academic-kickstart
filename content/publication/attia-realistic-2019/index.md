abstract: "In this presented work, we propose a realistic hair simulator using image blending for dermoscopic images. This hair simulator can be used for benchmarking and validation of the hair removal methods and in data augmentation for improving computer aided diagnostic tools. We adopted one of the popular implementation of image blending to superimpose realistic hair masks to hair lesion. This method was able to produce realistic hair masks according to a predefined mask for hair. Thus, the produced hair images and masks can be used as ground truth for hair segmentation and removal methods by inpainting hair according to a pre-defined hair masks on hairfree areas. Also, we achieved a realism score equals to 1.65 in comparison to 1.59 for the state-of-the-art hair simulator."
