abstract: "Malignant melanomas are the most deadly type of skin cancers. Early diagnosis is a key for successful treatment and survival. The paper presents the system for supporting the process of diagnosis of skin lesions in order to detect a malignant melanoma. The paper describes the development process of an intelligent system purposed for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Presented system can be used as a decision support system for primary care physicians and as a system capable of self-examination of the skin with usage of dermatoscope. The system utilizes computational intelligence methods for proper classification of the dermoscopic features extracted from the medical images. The paper also proposes the extension of the well know ABCD method used for malignant melanoma diagnosis. The proposed system is tested on 126 and trained on 80 skin moles and the obtained results are very promising."
