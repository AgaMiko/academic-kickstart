summary: Have you ever wondered about the name of the bird you just heard singing? A group of women from local Polish chapter of Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS) organization not only thought about it but also decided to create a solution, on their own, to be able to detect birds species — based on the sound they make.
